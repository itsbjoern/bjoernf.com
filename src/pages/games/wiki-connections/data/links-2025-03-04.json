  "summary": "The 2021 Credit Karma Money 250 was the 18th stock car race of the 2021 NASCAR Xfinity Series season, and the inaugural running of the event, when NASCAR decided to return to Atlanta for two races a year instead of the previous one. The race was held on Saturday, July 10, 2021 in Hampton, Georgia at Atlanta Motor Speedway, a 1.54 miles (2.48\u00a0km) permanent asphalt quad-oval intermediate speedway. The race was extended to 164 laps from the scheduled 163 due to a NASCAR overtime finish. In a historic 102nd win in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, Kyle Busch of Joe Gibbs Racing would win his last race for the team. Jeb Burton of Kaulig Racing and Noah Gragson of JR Motorsports would score the rest of the podium positions, taking 2nd and 3rd, respectively.",

It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on a combination of shared social characteristics such as culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics, religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history, and to promote national unity or solidarity.
