      I am someone that likes to dabble and try things. And sometimes it just
      goes unexpectedly well.

      My <Ref text="blog" href="/blog" /> gathers all the posts about the fun
      stuff I like to work with and try out. I designate this space for my hobby
      projects and other interesting titbits I encounter when working. You might
      want to check out <Ref text="PDFBlaze" href="https://pdfblaze.com" /> or <Ref
        text="Vechsel"
        href="https://github.com/itsbjoern/vechsel"
      />, or browse my <Ref text="other projects" href="/projects" />. I may
      also occasionally post about my research or simply just braindump some
      thoughts.

      I have always enjoyed learning (and educating others) about all the weird
      little bits and intricacies that you encounter during software
      development. Maybe I can shed some light on these weirdnesses or maybe you
      are just here to have a snoop around, don&apos;t let me stop you. You can
      find links to my socials above, I am also on <Ref
        text="Mastodon"
        rel="me"
        href="https://fosstodon.org/@itsbjoern"
      /> and <Ref text="X" rel="me" href="https://x.com/itsbjoern" />.

    </span>
    <span>
      I&apos;m a software engineer, originally from Germany and now living and
      working in the UK since 2018. As of right now I am employed as a senior
      software engineer at
      <Ref text="Simply Do Ideas" href="https://simplydo.co.uk" /> in Cardiff
      🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿.
    </span>
    <span>
      I have finished my PhD degree at{" "}
      <Ref text="Cardiff University" href="https://cardiff.ac.uk" />. I had
      always been fascinated with the psychology surrounding the use of
      technology and being able to research Human Computer Interaction to this
      extent was a great experience. You can find my thesis and other research
      papers in the <Ref text="projects" href="/projects" /> section.

      This is a public view of my habit tracker for this year, if you're
      interested in the same you can <Ref
        text="create your own habit tracker"
        href="/fun/habits"
      /> using my website. Just like this one trackers can be embedded into any
      website, no information will be shared unless you explicitly choose to do
      so, and even if you do it will only share the count of completions, not
      what the habit actually is.
