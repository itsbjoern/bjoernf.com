      I am someone that likes to dabble and try things. And sometimes it just
      goes unexpectedly well.

      This <Ref text="blog" href="/blog" /> gathers all the posts about the fun
      stuff I like to work with and try out. I designate this space for my hobby
      projects and other interesting titbits I encounter when working. I may
      also occasionally post about my research or simply just braindump some
      thoughts.

      I have always enjoyed learning (and educating others) about all the weird
      little bits and intricacies that you encounter during software
      development. Maybe I can shed some light on these weirdnesses or maybe you
      are just here to have a snoop around, don&apos;t let me stop you. You can
      find links to my socials above, I am also on <Ref
        text="Mastodon"
        rel="me"
        href="https://fosstodon.org/@itsbjoern"

      I&apos;m a software engineer, originally from Germany and now living and
      working in the UK for more than `new Date().getFullYear() - 2018` years.
      As of right now I am employed as a senior software engineer at

      I have just finished my PhD degree at{" "}
      <Ref text="Cardiff University" href="https://cardiff.ac.uk" />. I had
      always been fascinated with the psychology surrounding the use of
      technology and being able to research Human Computer Interaction to this
      extent was a great experience. You can find my thesis and other research
      papers in the <Ref text="projects" href="/projects" /> section.
